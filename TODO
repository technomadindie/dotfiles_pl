Notes:
Some of these versions are quite old. Consider updating to newer versions for security and feature improvements.
tkdiff doesn't have an official GitHub repository. It's typically distributed with Tcl/Tk.
The "/home/nv/bin" path is likely specific to your system and not a GitHub project.
To set up your own bin for each of these, you would typically:
Download the release for your platform
Extract it to a directory of your choice
Add that directory to your PATH as you've done
For some tools, you might need to compile from source, especially for older versions.
